# RAG-chatbot
Built a fully local RAG chatbot trained on my personal portfolio data using LangChain, FAISS, and Ollama (Mistral). Implemented semantic search with HuggingFace embeddings and conversational memory to answer questions about my skills, projects, and experience through an interactive Streamlit interface.
